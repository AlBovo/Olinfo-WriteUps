# Olimpiadi Italiane di Informatica

## Luiss Training Camp
Every year the <a href="https://www.luiss.it/">LUISS</a> organizes a contest before the second selection of the OII to teach to a lot of students how to start writing code for the competition.

## Terry
Terry is the friendly name of the second selection of the OII contest where you must write code that can be really slow or that uses too much memory, the only thing you must do is to solve the problem.
This is the link of the <a href="https://territoriali.olinfo.it/">platform of training</a>.

## Training
